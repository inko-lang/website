Inko 0.4.1 has been released, fixing a bug that would occur when connecting to
to an address using the socket API.

This release includes a fix for connecting a socket to another socket. The way
connecting sockets was implemented could lead to a variety of different issues,
such as Inko trying to connect over and over again.

More information about the problem and fixes can be found in commit
[53675b][fix].
