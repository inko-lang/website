In 2018 we migrated from [GitHub](https://github.com/) to
[GitLab.com](https://gitlab.com/), as the features provided by GitLab at the
time far exceeded that of GitHub, such as a good continuous integration service.
While using a service other than GitHub meant we'd likely see fewer
contributions, we had hope that GitLab.com would become more popular over time.

Unfortunately, this never happened, and GitHub as a whole has much improved
since 2018. In addition, GitHub has various features we'd like to use that
GitLab is missing, such as content moderation support and discussion forums.

One of our goals for 2023 is to increase awareness and interest in Inko, and
attract more contributors to the project. It has become clear we can't achieve
those goals if we isolate ourselves from the platform (GitHub) most developers
are familiar with. As such we've decided to move all Inko related projects from
GitLab back to GitHub, and you can now find us
[here](https://github.com/inko-lang/). The website and documentation have all
been updated accordingly. The GitLab projects are still available but archived,
ensuring any links to them remain accessible.

As part of this work we've also ensured all projects use "main" as the default
branch, instead of a mixture of "main" for newer projects and "master" for some
of the older ones, so make sure to update any Git clones accordingly.
