title: A language for building concurrent software with confidence
body: |
  Inko makes it easy to build concurrent software, without having to worry about
  unpredictable performance, unexpected runtime errors, data races, and type
  errors.

  Inko features deterministic automatic memory management, move semantics,
  static typing, type-safe concurrency, efficient error handling, and more.
